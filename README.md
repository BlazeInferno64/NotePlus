# Patch Notes
NotePlus Version 5.0 is here!!!

1. **New Option Added**  
   You can now instantly create a new blank document by clicking the **`New`** option in the **File** tab or by pressing **`Ctrl + Alt + J`**.

2. **Performance Improvements & Optimizations**  
   NotePlus has been further optimized to deliver better performance across different platforms.

3. **Optimized File Reading**  
   File reading is now more memory-efficient, significantly improving performance on low-end devices.

4. **Search Query Parameters Support**  
   You can now interact with NotePlus directly using URL search query parameters. Two parameters are supported: **`text`** and **`save`**.

   **Examples:**
   - **`text`**  
     When you visit:  
     `https://note-plus-mu.vercel.app/?text=hello+world`  
     NotePlus will automatically extract **“hello world”** and populate the editor with it.

   - **`save`**  
     NotePlus can also automatically save text as a `.txt` file. To enable this, both `text` and `save` parameters are required.  
     The `save` parameter accepts `true` or `false`.

     Example:  
     `https://note-plus-mu.vercel.app/?text=ok&save=true`  
     This will extract **“ok”** and save it to your device as a `.txt` file.

5. **Bug Fixes & Stability Improvements**  
   Fixed several minor UI issues and feature-related bugs.

6. **Close Tab Option Added**  
   You can now close the currently active NotePlus tab by selecting **`Close Tab`** from the **File** tab or by pressing **`Ctrl + Alt + F`**.

7. **New Tab Option Added**  
   Create a new untitled NotePlus document in a separate tab by clicking **`New Tab`** in the **File** tab or pressing **`Ctrl + Alt + P`**.

8. **File Info Viewer**  
   - Open any local file using **`Ctrl + Alt + O`** or the **Open** option in the **File** tab.  
   - Then press **`Ctrl + Alt + K`** or select **`File Info`** from the **File** tab.  
   - The **File Info Viewer** will display basic details about the selected file.

9. **Fetch Text**
