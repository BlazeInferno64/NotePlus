# Patch Notes
NotePlus Version 4.0 is here!!!

1. `New` Option is here: Now you can directly create a new blank document by clicking on the `New` option present in the file tab, or by pressing `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `J` on your keyboard!
2. Improved Features & Optimization: NotePlus has been more optimized for various platforms.
3. Optimized file reading: NotePlus can now read files more memory efficiently, which will help a lot in low-end devices.
4. Added search query params: Now you can directly interact with NotePlus by providing search query params in the url, you have two search query params for this,i.e, `text` & `save`.

   Let's see a brief example regarding this:-
      1. `text`: Whenever you type: https://note-plus-mu.vercel.app/ and add a `text` param to the url, NotePlus will automatically extract the text present in the `text` param for 
                 you. Your URL will look something like this https://note-plus-mu.vercel.app/?text=hello+world , here hello world will get extracted and filled in the text editor.
      2. `save`:NotePlus can also directly save the text to your device as an .txt  file, but you need to have `text` and `save` search params for it to work. The `save` param takes 
                two input `true` and `false`. Your URL will look something like this https://note-plus-mu.vercel.app/?text=ok&save=true , here NotePlus will automatically extract 
                the text present inside the `text` param ('ok' in this case), and save it your device as an .txt file.
5. Bugs & Issues Fixes: Fixed some minor ui bugs and feature related issues.
6. `Close Tab` Option is here: Now you can directly close current active NotePlus tab by clicking on the `Close Tab` button present in the file tab, or by pressing `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `F` on your keyboard!
7. `New Tab` Option is here: Now you can directly create a new Untitled NotePlus document in another tab by clicking on the `New Tab` button present in the file tab, or by pressing `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `P` on your keyboard!
