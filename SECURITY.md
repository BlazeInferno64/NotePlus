# Security Policy 2.0

## Supported Versions


The latest version of the web app would get updated in future which in turn might change the whole working functionality of the web app. To help decide this I would make a community post in the discussions tab so make sure to keep an eye on it.

## Reporting a Vulnerability


If any vulnerabilities/issues/bugs are found please open up an issue in this repo


# Update deployment

Expect to get an update of blaze audio player within 3-4 days of vulnerabilities/issues/bugs being reported. I would definitely try my best to patch it and deploy it as soon as possible meanwhile feel free to look around the source code which powers the web app :)
